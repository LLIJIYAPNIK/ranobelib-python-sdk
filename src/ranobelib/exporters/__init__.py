"""Exporter protocol and format registry.

A new export format is a new module in this package: define a class implementing
``Exporter`` and decorate it with ``@register`` — no changes needed here or in ``sdk.py``.
Every module in this package is auto-imported below so its ``@register`` runs on its own.
