"""Rough size estimation for already-fetched chapters/volumes, and whole-title sampling.

The API exposes no content-length or image-size field anywhere (see docs/api-notes.md), so
any size here is necessarily approximate for the image portion: chapter text is measured
exactly (the UTF-8 byte length of ``Chapter.content``), but each embedded ``<img>`` is
assumed to weigh ``average_image_size`` bytes rather than downloaded to measure precisely —
doing that would cost the same network traffic this module exists to help avoid paying
upfront. The result approximates the underlying content size, not a specific export
format's file size (epub's zip compression, pdf's layout overhead, fb2's XML verbosity are
not modeled) — enough to decide whether a title is worth downloading, not to predict an
exported file's exact byte count.
