"""Download an entire title in one call with RanobeLib.download_title().

download_title() fetches every chapter of a title without the caller having to enumerate
volumes/chapters by hand (compare to manually looping get_volumes() over every volume
number). Two things make it different from the other bulk methods:

1. `chapter_delay` — an extra pause *after each downloaded chapter*, on top of the
   ApiClient's own request pacing/backoff (see "Rate limiting" in CLAUDE.md). This is a
   bulk-download-specific courtesy delay, not a proxy for the client's internal settings,
   which stay client-only and aren't exposed through RanobeLib.
2. Translation ambiguity is resolved for the *whole title at once*: instead of raising on
   the first ambiguous chapter it finds (like get_chapter() does), it first checks every
   chapter, then raises a single MultipleTitleTranslationsError listing *all* ambiguous
   chapters together — so you're not stuck fixing one chapter, rerunning, hitting the next
   ambiguous one, rerunning again, and so on.

`on_chapter` — an optional `(completed: int, total: int) -> None` callback, called once
per chapter downloaded. This is separate from the `verbosity` console progress bar (see
CLAUDE.md's roadmap step 23): `verbosity` prints to *this process's* terminal, which is no
help to a caller that isn't a terminal at all — e.g. a web backend running download_title()
in a background job, which needs to report "chapter N of M" to a browser through its own
polling/SSE status endpoint instead. Both can be used together; `on_chapter` doesn't replace
`verbosity`.

#
# Note chapter "1"'s branches are listed in the opposite order from chapters "0"/"2" above —
# translation_index=0 resolves by each chapter's own branch order, not a shared branch_id,
# which is why it ends up picking a different team for chapter "1" than for "0"/"2" here.
# Use branch_id instead of translation_index when you know the specific translation you
# want and it's shared across chapters (same idea as 07_translation_selection.py, applied
# title-wide).
